  * Mobile Menu: On smaller screens, click the "hamburger" icon to toggle the mobile navigation menu.

 Customization

  * Content: Modify the text content within `index.html` to update headings, paragraphs, and links.
  * Styling: Adjust Tailwind CSS classes directly in `index.html` or add/modify custom styles in `style.css` to change the look and feel.
